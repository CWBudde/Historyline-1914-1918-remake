## Look
Six elevated overhead painted views of the same WWI Sopwith Camel. A distinct period silhouette,
fixed upper-left lighting and technical magenta owner paint; other materials stay natural.

## Base prompt
Use case: historical-scene. Create ONE newly authored transparent tactical SPRITE ATLAS of the SAME Sopwith Camel. Exact canvas1024x1536 RGBA, TWO columns by THREE rows of512x512 cells. SIX complete small isolated aircraft, one percell. Whole aircraft including wingtips, propeller and tail must fit inside central300x300box of each512pxcell, centred at(256,261), leaving at least90px genuinely alpha-zero padding on all sides. Do not fill cells or let wings cross cell boundaries. Same scale across six views.
HEADINGS row-major: TOPLEFT N = propeller/nose UP, tail DOWN; TOPRIGHT NW = propeller/nose UPPERLEFT, tail LOWERRIGHT; MIDDLELEFT SW = propeller/nose LOWERLEFT, tail UPPERRIGHT; MIDDLERIGHT S = propeller/nose DOWN, tail UP; BOTTOMLEFT SE = propeller/nose LOWERRIGHT, tail UPPERLEFT; BOTTOMRIGHT NE = propeller/nose UPPERRIGHT, tail LOWERLEFT. Aircraft FRONT is its PROPELLER end, never the tail. Six different independently painted 3Dorientations, never rotate or mirror a finished image.
Subject: Sopwith Camel compact single-seat BIPLANE fighter. Exactly TWO main wing levels: broad nearly straight top wing and smaller lower wing with slight upward dihedral, paired interplane struts, short stout tapered fabric fuselage, round natural silver rotary-engine cowling, TWO parallel small forward machine guns beneath a distinctive raised HUMP immediately ahead of ONE open cockpit. ONE two-bladed natural wood propeller at FRONT, rounded triangular fin, fixed spoked two-wheel landing gear. Shaded technical magenta fabric wings/fuselage/tail, natural silver cowling, natural wood propeller/struts and black tyres. Compact hump must be readable in every view. No third wing and no elongated inline-engine nose.
Fixed elevated overhead strategy camera looking mostly down, top surfaces visible with enough side height to distinguish each wing level, aircraft level. Same soft diffuse light from SCREENupperLEFT in every cell. Finely hand-painted WWI game illustration with strong readable48px silhouette, crisp natural antialiased edges and believable fabric, wood and metal. Same wing count, equipment, proportions, object and crew count in every view. No pilot protruding from cockpit. TECHNICALMAGENTA owner-painted fabric retains natural shaded values; all metal, wood and tyres stay natural. TRUE alpha transparency outside aircraft and through open gaps. NO ground, sky, backdrop, haze, glow, shadows, checkerboard, vignette, propeller blur, smoke, clouds, text, letters, numbers, labels, crosses, national insignia, flags, grid or frame. Transparent padding is RGBA(0,0,0,0). Exactly six complete planes and NO detached fragments.
